# üöÄ START HERE - Complete Setup Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Read This First!

Your job portal has been completely upgraded with:
- ‚úÖ Full authentication system (register/login)
- ‚úÖ Protected job creation (requires login)
- ‚úÖ Working job applications (requires login)
- ‚úÖ User profiles with application history
- ‚úÖ Applicants visible to job posters
- ‚úÖ Proper database relationships

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST reset your database before starting!

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Reset PostgreSQL Database

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
# Connect to PostgreSQL
psql -U postgres

# Switch to your database
\c jobmanagement

# Drop all tables (this will delete existing data)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS job_applications CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS jobs CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users CASCADE;

# Exit
\q
```

**Why?** The database schema has changed significantly. Old data will cause errors.

---

### Step 2: Update Backend Environment Variables

Open: `backend-nestjs\.env`

Make sure it has these variables:

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=surya213
DB_NAME=jobmanagement

# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# JWT Secret (REQUIRED - ADD THIS!)
JWT_SECRET=my-super-secret-jwt-key-for-development-only
```

**Important:** The `JWT_SECRET` is NEW and REQUIRED!

---

### Step 3: Start Backend

```powershell
cd backend-nestjs
npm run start:dev
```

**Wait for:** `Application is running on: http://localhost:3001`

TypeORM will automatically create all tables with the new schema.

**If you see errors about "posted_by_id":** You didn't reset the database. Go back to Step 1.

---

### Step 4: Test Backend (Optional but Recommended)

Open a NEW PowerShell window:

```powershell
cd cybermindworks-repo
node test-auth-flow.js
```

You should see 14 tests pass. If any fail, check the error messages.

---

### Step 5: Start Frontend

Open a NEW PowerShell window:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm start
```

Browser will open at `http://localhost:3000`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start - "column posted_by_id contains null values"
**Solution:** Reset database (Step 1)

### Backend won't start - "JWT_SECRET not found"
**Solution:** Add JWT_SECRET to .env file (Step 2)

### Tests failing - "ECONNREFUSED"
**Solution:** Backend not running. Start backend (Step 3)

### Can't create jobs - "401 Unauthorized"
**Solution:** You need to login first

### Can't see applicants
**Solution:** Only the job poster can see applicants for their jobs
